  - rscadd: Added capped pipes, a 40 volume beaker made from welding a straight pipe.
      If welded again it will be capped and can't be spilled/filled/emptied. If you
      add a fuse (cable coil) before sealing the pipe it will become a pipe bomb,
      when detonated it heats up reagent contents by a random amount from five to
      twenty degrees.
